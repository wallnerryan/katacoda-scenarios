Please wait for the environment to load.


Here are some handy links that should help with the troubleshooting:

Please wait for the Portworx pods to be Ready 2/2, they will restart as a rolling update. This may take up to 10 minutes.
`watch kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l name=portworx`{{execute}}

To get back to the terminal:
```clear```{{execute interrupt}}
